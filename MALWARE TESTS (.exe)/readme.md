### жмармизка/Zhmarmizka Virus
This piece of Malware is worse than [Enderman's](https://youtube.com/@endermanch) **NoEscape** virus,  
Slowing down you device, filling up your disk and much more,  
Hence having the tagline **Zhmarchiskva/жмарчисква** or **It sizzles** in Bulgarian.  
  
#### Programming languages
C  
VBS  
BAT  
REG  
HTML  

Getting rid of **жмармизка**? Well, I'll upload a video soon on [YT](https://youtube.com/@cubeultm).  
For now, follow [Enderman's NoEscape Removal Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4oATWyMMH4A), and uninstall the other bloatware.  
  
What **жмармизка** does? It will lock up your computer after **10 startups**,  
Unless you delete the startup logger files stored in random locations around your **C Drive**.  
Also, it removes your MBR, so your system can't boot until you restore it.
