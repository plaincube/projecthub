Welcome to Non-Stop CMD 2!
This version automatically invokes the killer for you after a 15 second timer ends.
The killer, kill.bat, kills the spammer, sppammer.bat, by the windows title, exclude.
If any other application has a window title of the same name, exclude, they will be killed as well.
The killer, kill.bat, is coded so that it will attempt to kill all the spammer windows for a number of times (24 X 2 times, ns-main invokes 2 windows).
This is for educational purposes only.
